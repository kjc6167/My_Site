        <p>My name is Kyle Cronin and I am currently a freshman at Penn State Behrend. I am undecided at the moment, but digital arts, media, and technology is a major that I am considering. I am also interested in biology and psychology, which are majors that I might pursue. Some of my interests include gardening, gaming, and reading. I made this website as a single place where I can showcase my skills, education, experience, and interests. I hope you enjoy browsing this site and consider reaching out to me! Thank you!</p>
