        <h2>User-Interface</h2>

            <p>After browsing several indie games on <a href="https://itch.io/">itch.io</a>, a website for finding and sharing indie games for free, I discovered a gem in <i>Tadpole Tales</i>. Before I dive into the story, setting, characters, and so forth, I will begin discussing the user-interface. Now, the user-interface is an aspect of a video game that is extremely important, or at least more significant than most people admit, because it gives people an first impression of the game. Additionally, the user-interface is going to be what the player navigates through to start a game, change settings, learn extra information, and continue or log off. So to begin, the first impression that <i>Tadpole Tales</i>’s user-interface gave me was that this was a very cute and beautiful game. The game’s name is large, in the top right corner, and has an endearing tadpole in it, providing some insight into what this game entails. The hand-drawn aesthetic, smooth shapes, bright colors, and fun music of the menu illustrate a fun, lighthearted adventure. The little tadpole eggs that you click to navigate the main menu are adorable, well-drawn, and also show a glimpse into what is in store. Likewise, the river taking up the majority of the menu screen and the plants on either side suggest that the setting will be a natural environment. The exit button is small and in the top right, implying that the creators, as they should, do not want you to leave without exploring first. Navigating through the user-interface is also very simple to do. Clicking on the egg displaying “Options: opens the options menu, where you can adjust volume settings. Furthermore, clicking on the egg labeled “Extras” opens the extras menu, featuring best scores, intro and outro clips, and contact information. Now, let’s discuss what happens after losing. Since, <i>Tadpole Tales</i> is a run and gun game, more on that later, you lose quite a lot, meaning that the game over screen needs to be comprehensive and easy to navigate. In the case of this indie game, I can attest that the game over screen is both of these. Upon losing a playthrough, a progress bar shows how far you traveled, how many bosses you defeated, your overall score, your time, and the options to either continue or return to the main menu. Overall, the easily navigated user-interface of this game creates a fun, lighthearted, and aesthetically pleasing impression of a game set in a natural environment.</p> 
            
        <h2>Backstory</h2>
            <div class="UI"><img src="images/tadpole/backstory/bckstry.png" alt="Pool of frogs with the caption 'A myth from the past said that there was a beautiful river inhabited by frogs.'"/>

            <p>All great games have some sort of backstory, and <i>Tadpole Tales</i> doesn’t disappoint. When first opening the game, a series of slides reveals the backstory of this world. I’ve decided to display the most important slides, in my opinion, to give a brief summary of this game’s backstory and how it relates to our own world. First, the audience is introduced to the setting: a river inhabited by frogs. In the game, you travel along a pristine river, banked by beautiful foliage, reflecting the setting introduced in the backstory. Then, the next slide reveals that when King Froggo ruled, the river was blessed with “flowers and sunshine.” All the frogs and tadpoles lived peacefully until three monsters sought to claim the river themselves, intoxicating everything in the process. A brave tadpole must defeat the evil within the river to wash the toxins and revive the frogs’ home. This story is probably a metaphor for how natural ecosystems were thriving until human greed for natural resources resulted in pollution that damaged these ecosystems and harmed wildlife. Additionally, it is also mentioning how the tadpole must “defeat the great evil that now plagues the river” which could be another metaphor for how corporations who pollute must be confronted in order to ensure wildlife safety. Although these are not explicit, by having the player work against agents of pollution, the game does promote environmental awareness and protection, which also reflects modern concerns about natural ecosystem preservation.</p>
        
        <h2>Mission</h2>
            <div class="UI"><img src="images/tadpole/cleanup.png" alt="Tadpole swimming on the river shooting water droplets with the phrase 'Clean 'em up!' overhead."/>
            <img src="images/tadpole/cleanNMEs.png" alt="Tadpole cleaning the toxins off two enemies, purifying and pacifying them."/> 
            <img src="images/tadpole/bigfishclean.png" alt="Tadpole cleaning toxins off a big fish, purifying and pacifying them."/> </div>
            <p>The mission of a video game is the goal that the player works toward achieving. Much of the mission is described in the backstory, but some of the specific actions are illustrated by gameplay. As mentioned previously by the backstory, the ultimate goal of the tadpole, or player, is to “wash the toxins away and save the precious river they call Home.” This is very clearly painted by the backstory because the polluted enemies are portrayed very ominously with shadowy figures and glowing yellow eyes. But in game, they are actively working against the tadpole, emphasizing that they are dangerous enemies that must be defeated. Now the way the tadpole defeats these enemies is extremely indicative to the mission at hand. Instead of pulverizing them with lasers or bullets, the tadpole sprays them with droplets of water, cleaning them of their toxins. This interaction illuminates that the animals are not the enemy, the pollution is. When you start a playthrough, before enemies approach, the even game tells the player to “Clean ‘em up!” and that's exactly what you do. The tadpole cleans the enemies from the pollution, and once cleansed, they revert back to their normal forms and peacefully retreat underwater. The enemies have glowering scowls, but once cleaned, they dawn cute smiles. This fact indicates that the pollution turns normally peaceful animals into hostile enemies. Likewise, they are grateful to be free of the effects of the pollution and further emphasizes the environmental message of the game.</p>
            
        
        <h2>Progression</h2>
            <div class="UI"><img src="images/tadpole/arcs/arc.png" alt="Tadpole in an egg in front of the first arch, featuring tadpoles."/>
            <img src="images/tadpole/arcs/arc2.png" alt="Tadpole with two legs in front of the second arch, featuring tadpoles and tadpoles with two legs."/>
                <img src="images/tadpole/arcs/arc3.png" alt="Tadpole with two legs in front of the third arch, featuring tadpoles, tadpoles with two legs, and frogs."/>
                <img src="images/tadpole/arcs/arc4.png" alt="Tadpole in front of the fourth arch, made up of brown brambles over toxic purple water."/>
            <img src="images/tadpole/arcs/brambles.png" alt="A tunnel of brown brambles over toxic purple water. "/></div>
            <p>As mentioned previously, <i>Tadpole Tales</i> is a run and gun type game, meaning that you are constantly moving forward and defeating enemies to continue progressing. This fact is important because it illustrates how progression, and not reaching a certain level or obtaining a specific object, is the key indicator of success in that it must be made to complete the mission. Likewise, progression is how the player encounters new enemies, bosses, and settings. Knowing that progress is an important factor in this game, <i>Tadpole Tales</i> lets the player know how far they are in-game with different wooden arches that it places before a new section. Likewise, the type of NPSc sitting on the arches also are indicative of the player's progress. To begin, the first arch appears right as you start your game, with only a few little tadpoles sitting atop. This arch reflects how your journey has just begun and that the game starts off very easy. The second arch, however, hosts tadpoles and more mature tadpoles with two legs, showing the player that they have beaten the first boss, have progressed farther, and should expect more of a challenge. The third arch holds tadpoles, tadpoles with two legs, and adult frogs. This arch celebrates the tadpoles victory of the challenging otter boss, indicates that more progress has been made, but also warns the player about the great difficulty that awaits in the next section. The final arch is by far the most ominous and telling in terms of progress and difficult. The last arch is actually made of thorny brambles, with no allies sitting atop, and purple water sitting underneath. This arch tells the player that they are the final stretch of the game, but that this last enemy will be the most challenging of all. The purple water also indicates that the enemy beyond the arch is the source of pollution, and defeating them would mean that the mission is complete. Unlike the other arches, this final one turns out to be a long tunnel of brambles, possibly indicating how long the final battle will be and how powerful the final boss is. Additionally, the length of the thorny tunnel could be used to juxtapose how pristine, lush, and fertile the rest of the river is compared to this new setting in which pollution has taken over, killing plant life, turning the water purple, and corrupting animals. The player is essentially traveling to a new setting, the final boss’s realm, in order to defeat them.</p>       
        
        <h2>Different Forms</h2>
            <div class="UI"><img src="images/tadpole/tadpoleladybug.png" alt="Tadpole shooting water droplets at a ladybug and two enemies."/>
            <img src="images/tadpole/tadpolelegs.png" alt="Tadpole with two legs attacking several enemies and flies."/>
            <img src="images/tadpole/frog.png" alt="Frog shooting large water droplets at two enemies."/></div> 
            <p>For most run and gun games, there are various types of projectiles the player can fire such as a single shot are a triple shot. Within <i>Tadpole Tales</i>, however, you can only play one character, but they have three  forms you can play. The type of projectiles the player shoots directly correlates to specific forms and the number of hearts one has. For instance, at one and two hearts, the player is in tadpole form, being able to shoot droplets of water at a standard rate to defeat enemies. Collecting a third heart transforms you into a tadpole with two legs, which fires water droplets at a much faster rate than previously. Finally, collecting a fourth heart turns you into an adult frog, who can fire three sprays of giant water balls. These different forms reward the player for avoiding projectiles and collecting hearts, making the game easier or more difficult depending on which form the player is in. An interesting detail that I noticed after several playthroughs was that all the forms close their eyes when they fire water droplets, a trait that makes the different forms feel connected to each other.</p>               
        <h2>Normal Enemies, Neutral NPCs, and Hearts</h2>
            <div class="UI"><img src="images/tadpole/NMEfrogfly.png" alt="Image of enemy tadpole, tadpole with two legs, frog, and flies."/> 
            <img src="images/tadpole/bigfish.png" alt="Image of enemy big fish, ladybugs, and fly."/>  
            <img src="images/tadpole/dragonflysmallfish.png" alt="Image of enemy small fish, tadpoles, and golden dragonfly."/>
            <img src="images/tadpole/heart.png" alt="Image of several enemy tadpoles with two legs and a heart item."/></div>
            <p>As for the NPC characters, the majority of them are enemies who you must cleanse of pollution in order to defeat and free them. The main enemies include the tadpole, tadpole with 2 legs, frog, small fish, and large fish. The enemies spit different pollutant projectiles at the player, causing damage. The tadpole must shoot water droplets at these enemies to defeat them and progress throughout the game. The challenging part is remembering the ways each enemy attacks and targeting the highest priority targets. For instance, failing to take out the big enemies early on might lead to your downfall. It is also challenging to aim accurately at your opponents while dodging a myriad of projectiles. Sometimes you will have to stop shooting to move faster and reposition. Moving onto neutral NPCs, we have the ladybug and fly. These NPCs fly over the river and are more neutral characters. They occasionally drop clumps of dirt, which damage you, but killing them might yield an extra heart, which is necessary to transform into more powerful forms. The only NPC that is solely beneficial is the golden dragonfly, which always drops a heart when killed. However, the golden dragonfly is rare, and not often seen in the game. As previously mentioned, the only notable object in the game is the heart which, when touched, will grant you an extra heart. Now, to clarify exactly each NPC and the heart object, from left to right, the first image features the tadpole, tadpole with two legs, frog, and fly. The second image displays the big fish and ladybug NPCs (as well as some flies). The third image shows the small fish and the golden dragonfly (with some tadpoles). The fourth image shows several enemy NPCs with the shining heart object in the middle of the river.</p>      
        <h2>Bosses and Completing the Game</h2>
            <div class="UI"><img src="images/tadpole/bosses/duck.png" alt="Frog attacking the first boss, a duck."/>
            <img src="images/tadpole/bosses/cleanduck.png" alt="Image of the duck boss after being purified."/>
            <img src="images/tadpole/bosses/otter.png" alt="Tadpole attacking the second boss, an otter."/>
            <img src="images/tadpole/bosses/cleanotter.png" alt="Image of the otter boss after being purified."/>
                <img src="images/tadpole/bosses/toad.png" alt="Tadpole in front of the final boss, a toad, sleeping."/></div>
            <p> As most games do, <i>Tadpole Tales</i> has several bosses, or difficult enemies that must be beat to achieve certain milestones. The bosses are by far the most challenging part of this game, but by beating a boss, you will be able to progress further down the river and in the game, encountering new enemies and getting closer to winning. To begin discussing each boss, the first boss is the Duck. Now, the Duck has three different attacks: the large projectile (in which he throws a baseball, rubber duck, etc.), projectile spray (where he fires a large spray of pollutant projectiles), and homing rockets that land on the tadpoles latest position. Upon defeating the Duck, the player is able to travel through the second section of the river. Next is the second boss, the Otter, who sets up otter bombs that explode on contact and fires an extremely fast spray of three pollutant projectiles. Once defeated, the player can journey through the third and final section of the river. After successfully traversing the final section of the river, the player swims through an ominous bramble tunnel to meet the final boss: the Giant Toad. The Giant Toad is by far the most challenging enemy to defeat in the game. Giant Toad creates enemy eggs, who fire projectile their own, and uses his tongue to lash out quick attacks. Much like normal enemies, upon defeat a boss, they become cleansed of their toxins, further enhancing the environmentalist concern presented by this game. Furthermore, after defeating and cleaning the final boss, a cutscene plays, showing how the player has “rid the river from its toxins and now it’s clean, pure, and with more friends!” This ending, again, reinforces the environmental message of the game while simultaneously retaining its wholesome and adorable nature. If the symbolism throughout the game of protecting our environment wasn’t clear enough, the final screen upon completing the game tells the player that “It is up to all of us to protect our Earth, just like this little tadpole (...)” The game creators are directly urging the player the importance of being environmental advocates and protecting wildlife from pollution, a message bigger than this game itself that I am happy to agree with. </p>
