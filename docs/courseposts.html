        <p>The most significant challenge for me as a new learner of HTML and CSS was learning how to be specific with styling. Using sections and lists in order to organize and stylize content was tricky because the syntax needs to be specific. As for WordPress, I found navigating the site and inserting content to be the most difficult aspect. There are certain steps users must take in order for the site to work how one wants it to, which can be an obstacle. I feel that HTML and CSS website editing provides much more options and freedoms when it comes to formatting and designing a website. WordPress forces users to select premade templates, which hinders creativity. When it comes to HTML and CSS, users must be very particular about the syntax and evaluate how new code will interact with pre-existing code, making it somewhat difficult to adjust the layout. Likewise, code can quickly become disorganized and hard to understand, so maintaining clean and orderly code is vital for editing in this format. Similarly, WordPressâ€™s constant pressure for users to use the post function can interfere with editing pages. Making sure that you are editing a specific page instead of just making a post will be helpful when making formatting adjustments. When it comes to skills necessary for developing a website in either format, organization, and consistency or pivotal in maintaining an effective site. Keeping a neat workflow of code enables users to easily edit, fix, and delete code. Finding broken coding or adjusting code to incorporate future content is made easier when the code is organized in a meaningful way. Additionally, retaining consistency throughout the pages on a website creates a more professional image for the site, as well as makes editing simpler. The skills in which I desire to improve on these websites are my coding and stylizing skills. I feel as though my code could be more concise and effective,  so I hope to learn how to shorten and use the most effective syntax for my formatting decisions. Although I believe my websites look rather good, there are some stylization options that I would like to implement. I lack the skill currently to make some of these changes, but I hope to eventually improve my skills in stylization to better edit the design of my websites.</p>
