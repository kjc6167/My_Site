        <p>The texts that I have decided to analyze were <i>Jane Eyre</i> and <i>Wuthering Heights</i>. Both of these novels are 19th-century fiction novels, so I assumed that a lot of their wording would be very similar. When I put both texts into Voyant tools, this theory proved to be relatively correct. In both texts’ word clouds, their five most popular words included “said”, “Mr”, and most of their main character’s respective names. I was shocked, however, to find that the words “little” and “like” were two of the most frequent words used in <i>Jane Eyre</i>. Additionally, I was surprised that “Rochester”, the name of the main love interest in <i>Jane Eyre</i>, did not appear in the top five most frequent words. On the other hand, <i>Wuthering Heights</i>’s top five list contained all character names or related titles except for the word “said”, which did not really surprise me. Overall, the Voyant tools analysis reassured what I had already anticipated about word frequency, although there were some words that either made or didn’t make the highest frequency list that shocked me.</p>

        <p>Moving onto AntConc, I started by comparing the texts’ N-gram clusters when the minimum cluster size was set to two. I quickly noticed that both novels’ most frequently used 2-gram was “of the”, a phrase that I somewhat expected since it can be used in a variety of scenarios. I then decided to look at the Keywords in Context (KWIC) to further investigate how this phrase was used in each text. Both novels used the word “beck”, a term that was unfamiliar to me, after “of the”. This fact was not surprising since both novels are based on the same time period. However, I was slightly surprised by how in <i>Jane Eyre</i>, the author tended to use the same words after “of the”, while the author of <i>Wuthering Heights</i> appeared to use a larger variety of words after the phrase. For instance, in <i>Jane Eyre</i>, the phrase “of the” is commonly followed by the word “bed”, possibly showing how the majority of the novel takes place in a confined space. On the other hand, in <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, the term “of the” is followed by words like “barn”, “bench”, and even “blaze”. These words indicate not only varying words after the phrase but various settings as well, possibly indicating that the plot guides the reader through different places. As for the rest of the 2-gram clusters, both books had relatively similar lists with similar phrases, which is what I expected. These phrases included various “I” statements as well as common prepositional phrases that are bound to be present in these types of novels. In conclusion, my 2-gram analysis within AntConc revealed mostly what I had anticipated, but a shared phrase in “of the” opened the door to valuable insight into the possible settings within each text.</p>

        <p>I then decided to bump up the minimum N-gram size, in AntConc, to three in hopes that I would see some more interesting phrases, and I was correct. As expected, of the 3-gram phrases were “I” statements and prepositional phrases that provide context. However, I realized that they shared a relatively frequently implemented phrase in “I could not”. I found this interesting because looking at the frequency of the phrase as well as the words surrounding it would give me insight into the main characters themselves. Thereby, I looked at the phrase in the Concordance view within both texts and gathered valuable information about the protagonists. Firstly, the phrase occurs much more often in <i>Jane Eyre</i>, indicating that Jane, the protagonist, is less confident or not as self-assured as her male counterpart in <i>Wuthering Heights</i>. Given that the novel is based in the 19th-century, a time where women were oppressed socioeconomically, I was not surprised. If society does not believe in a woman’s abilities or give them opportunities to flourish, how are they supposed to believe it themselves? <i>Wuthering Heights</i>’s main character is male, and seeing as it is based in the same time period, of course he will be more confident in himself. Men were praised and over-glorified in this era, which is reflected in the less frequent use of the phrase “I could not” throughout the text. Now looking at the words surrounding the phrase, <i>Jane Eyre</i> again uses the same word to follow the phrase while <i>Wuthering Heights</i> implements a wide array of words. For instance, in <i>Jane Eyre</i>, the most common word to follow the phrase “I could not” was “tell”. This word choice reflects how Jane might often be withholding information from those around her, or she simply lacks education in certain subjects to properly assess certain things. The oppression of women during this time often resulted in women keeping secrets from others, and women usually did not receive as much education as men, so both of these conclusions are very possible. On the other hand, in <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, the author again employs a myriad of words to follow “I could not”, with “tell” not appearing at all. This word choice reveals that although the protagonist of <i>Wuthering Heights</i> faces several physical and mental obstacles, he never feels hesitant to share information with others. Again, seeing as the main character is a man during the 19th-century, he has a lot more freedom to say what he pleases without fear of punishment or prosecution. To summarize, by looking at the 3-gram phrases most frequently used within both books, a lot of similarities that were anticipated were present; however, there were also several differences about the main characters that were revealed, through diction, that surprised me.</p>
